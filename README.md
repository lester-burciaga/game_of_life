# ReactJs Game Of Live 
[Live Demo](https://lester-burciaga.github.io/game_of_life/)

## Conway's Game of Life using React/Typescript

  It consists of a grid of cells which, based on a few mathematical rules,
can live, die or multiply. Depending on the initial conditions, the cells 
form various patterns throughout the course of the game.

## Rules

1. Each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
3. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
